This image dataset contains images of planets from our solar system. The dataset includes images of all eight planets in our solar system. The images are labeled with metadata that identifies the planet or object in the image.

The goal of this dataset is to train a computer vision model for object detection, specifically for detecting planets from our solar system.

By using this dataset for training, the model will be able to identify planets in images taken from telescopes or other space-based instruments. This has important applications in astronomy and space exploration, as it can help scientists identify and study planets in our solar system and beyond.
